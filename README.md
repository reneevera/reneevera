## üéØ Professional Overview
I bring over 25 years of diverse IT experience, starting with foundational technical roles like IT support and progressing to more complex responsibilities as a Network Administrator. This foundation led to leadership positions in IT and Project Management, where I honed my strategic planning and team management skills.

Over the past two years, I've shifted my focus to the cutting-edge fields of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. This passion fueled my relocation to Canada, where I've pursued advanced education and sought practical experience in these domains, concentrating on developing strong technical skills.

This combination of technical expertise, leadership experience, and entrepreneurial spirit equips me with a unique approach to problem-solving and innovation.
